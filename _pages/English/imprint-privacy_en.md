## Privacy Statement

>This website does NOT use cookies, so you have not seen or need to confirm _cookie-consent_. See below for details.

### Scope
This privacy statement informs users about the nature, scope and purposes of the collection and use of personal data by the responsible provider Dr. Peter Hruschka, Langenbruchweg 71, D-52080 Aachen, Germany, <a href="xmxaxixlxtxo:ixnxfxox@xaxrxcx4x2x.xdxe" onmouseover="this.href=this.href.replace(/x/g,'');">email (protected against spam)</a>, Phone: +49 172 2411656 on this website (hereinafter "Offer").<br />
<br />
The legal basis for data protection can be found in the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the German Telemedia Act (TMG).<br />
<br />

### Access data/ Server log files
The provider (or its web space provider) collects data about each access to the offer (so-called server log files). The access data includes:<br />
<br />
Name of the accessed website, file, date and time of access, amount of data transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider.<br/>
<br/>
The provider uses the log data only for statistical evaluations for the purpose of operation, security and optimization of the offer. However, the provider reserves the right to subsequently review the log data if there is a justified suspicion of illegal use based on concrete indications.

### Getting in contact
When contacting the provider (for example, via contact form or e-mail), the user's information is stored for the purpose of processing the request and in the event that follow-up questions arise.

### Comments and contributions
When users leave comments on the blog or other posts, their IP addresses are stored. This is done for the security of the provider, in case someone writes illegal content in comments and posts (insults, forbidden political propaganda, etc.). In this case, the provider itself can be prosecuted for the comment or post and is therefore interested in the identity of the author.


### Revocation, changes, corrections and updates
The user has the right, upon request and free of charge, to receive information about the personal data stored about him. In addition, the user has the right to correct incorrect data, blocking and deletion of his personal data, provided that this does not conflict with any legal obligation to retain data.
