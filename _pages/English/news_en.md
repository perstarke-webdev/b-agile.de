Together with my colleagues from the Atlantic Systems Guild, we have compiled many dozens of behavioral patterns - positive and negative, each of which we have given a characteristic name in our book ["Adrenaline Junkies and Template Zombies – Understanding Patterns of Project Behavior"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DY3KQHM/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1).

Adrenaline junkies, for example, are people who can only work when the seat of their pants is on fire and who proclaim a new top priority every 5 minutes. Surely you like such colleagues!

If you do project work, you need to know about:
- **Project Sluts** -  managers who can't say no
- **Children of Lake Wobegon** -  is everyone really above average?
- **Soviet Style** -  building the product no one can love
- **Hidden Beauty** -  an ethic that drives great developers
- **News Improvement** -  how status gets rosier as it travels higher in the organization
- **Marilyn Munster** -  she's on your project and you need her
- **Dead Fish** -  learning to appreciate project odor
- **Sanctity of the Half-baked Idea** -  the creative team’s best friend
- **Seelenverwandtschaft** (you'll just have to read the book)
and 77 more

How does such positive and negative behavior occur? The answer can be found in your company culture.

We drilled deeper: What actually determines a positive or negative corporate culture?

Corporate culture is probably the least scrutinized aspect of your work environment, but it is by no means inscrutable. In our book ["Happy to work here - understanding and improving the Culture at Work"](https://www.amazon.com/Happy-Work-Here-Understanding-Improving-ebook/dp/B08VHP27WP), we show you how improving your culture can lead to a happier working environment.

The book enables you
- to understand the existing corporate culture,
- uncover structures and understand the resulting behaviors,
- to decipher unspoken rules that have a poisoning effect on the working atmosphere,
- to change an unhealthy working climate in such a way that you and your environment feel comfortable.

We have distilled our observations and experiences from hundreds of organizations, identifying the influencing factors that make a good or bad corporate culture. We show you how to effectively influence these factors so you and your colleagues can say: **»Happy to work here.«**
